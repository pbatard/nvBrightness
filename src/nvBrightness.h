// Note that we use two GUIDs due to a Microsoft UTTERLY MADDENING BUG, where Windows silently
// drops the tray icon, for some arcane reason that I really am NOT ready to waste DAYS on.
// And it only happens to some versions of the executable, independently of their location and
// REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY WERE RECOMPILED FROM THE SAME SOURCE AS UNAFFECTED EXECUTABLES!!!
// So, Microsoft, you can go screw yourselves on that one, as I have better things to do than
// chase after a stupid Windows bug/limitation/whatever.
